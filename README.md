# Minefinder
I wrote this project in high school for my AP CS Principles final. It is a deliberate rip off of Minesweeper that I wrote purely to see if I could replicate it. 

Because of the lack of documentation and poor layout, this project serves as a reminder on the types of practices I need to avoid in the future. 

I highlighted the solutions in green for the first game for the sake of demonstration. 

The game can be accessed here: https://minesweeper-1.anttimeriluoto.repl.co/
