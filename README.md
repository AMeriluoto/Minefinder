# Minefinder
I wrote this project during my junior year of high school. It is a version of Minesweeper that I wrote to see if I could replicate it. 

I highlighted the solutions in green for the first game for the sake of demonstration. 

The game can be accessed here: https://Minefinder.anttimeriluoto.repl.co
